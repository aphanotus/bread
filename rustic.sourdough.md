### Ingredients

- 1 cup ripe sourdough starter
- 3/4 cups water, lukewarm
- 1 teaspoons instant yeast
- 1 1/4 teaspoons salt
- 2.5 cups all-purpose flour

### Procedure

- [ ] Combine all of the ingredients.
- [ ] Knead to form a smooth dough.
- [ ] Proof, in a lightly greased, covered bowl, until it's doubled in size, about 90 minutes.
- [ ] Elongate the dough ball by gently rolling it back and forth on an unfloured work surface. For a longer loaf, continue rolling until they're about 10" to 11" long.
- [ ] Place the loaf on parchment. Cover and let rise until very puffy, about 1 hour. 
- [ ] Spray the loaf with lukewarm water and dust generously with flour.
- [ ] Make two fairly deep diagonal slashes with a serrated bread knife.
- [ ] Bake at 425Â°F for 25-35 minutes, until it's a deep golden brown.
