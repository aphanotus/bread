## Apple Raisin Nut Bread

![](https://i.imgur.com/vhg0Iqp.jpg)

Last baked August 2022.

I cobbled this recipe together from several semi-successful ones (a [raisin twist bread](https://www.food.com/recipe/worlds-best-cinnamon-raisin-bread-not-bread-machine-98867
) and an [apple bread](https://www.seasonsandsuppers.ca/chunky-apple-yeast-bread/)). I think this one is more successful than either of those!

### Ingredients

- 50 g water (110-115˚F)
- 1 Tbsp active dry yeast
- 250 g ripe sourdough starter (or substitute with 125 g water and 125 g flour)
- 150 g warm milk (room temperature)
- 2 Tbsp granulated sugar
- 1 egg yolk
- 1/4 tsp vanilla extract
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 290 g all-purpose flour
- 4 Tbsp butter, softened
- 100 g raisins optionally

#### For the filling

- about 246 g cropped apples, peeled and diced (1-2 apples)
- 1/2 tsp nutmeg 
- 1/4 tsp cinnamon (optional)
- 60 g honey
- 1 egg yolk
- 80 g chopped nuts (optional; may be walnuts, pecans or almonds)

### Procedure

- [ ] Mix the yeast and warm water with a bit of honey or sugar. Let stand for 10 min.
- [ ] Meanwhile, combine the salt and flour in a large bowl.
- [ ] When the yeast culture is ready, combine all the dough ingredients, except for the butter and raisins.
- [ ] Mix in the softened butter, 1 Tbsp at a time.
- [ ] Knead for 12 min by hand or 7-8 in a mixer. 
- [ ] Add the raisins towards the end of the knead, or optionally include them in the filling. (Raisins will come apart if added too soon during kneading.)
- [ ] Place in a large, buttered, mixing bowl and turn to grease the surface of the dough.
- [ ] Rise until doubled, about 1 hour.
- [ ] Meanwhile, mix toward all the ingredients for the filling in a large bowl. 
- [ ] Set it aside, but pill the filling up on one side, to allow any excess water to pool at the bottom.
- [ ] Once risen, remove the dough to a floured work surface. 

> The filling needs to the heterogeneously arranged through the dough. The [raison bread](https://www.food.com/recipe/worlds-best-cinnamon-raisin-bread-not-bread-machine-98867
> ) recipe that was one inspiration for this bake suggested spreading the dough, covering it with filling and **rolling** it. That didn't work well, since the filling settled down in the large interior spaces. The [apple bread](https://www.seasonsandsuppers.ca/chunky-apple-yeast-bread/) recipe contributing here, suggested making two tubes of dough stuffed with filling, cutting the tubes into **short bits** and arranging the bits at different angles. This kept the filling in place well, but never looked good for me. It was hard to keep the loaf even, and some filling was always visible on the outside. An alternative I like is to **braid** similarly filled tubes of dough. The plaits seem to merge, but the effect is to have nice swirls of filling.

- [ ] Divide the dough into 2-3 equal parts, and gently pat into long rectangles.
- [ ] Scatter 2-3 equal parts of the filling evenly over of the dough rectangles, then them roll up. Pinch the seams together.
- [ ] Braid the dough tubes.
- [ ] Carefully transfer the braided dough into a lined, buttered loaf pan.
- [ ] Cover and rise until doubled, about 45 minutes.
- [ ] Optionally, wash the loaf with the remaining egg whites.
- [ ] Bake at 350˚F for 60 minutes, or until the interior temperature reaches 210˚F. After about 5 min cover loosely with aluminum foil to prevent over-browning of the top.
- [ ] Turn the bread out on a rack to cool.
- [ ] For the optional glaze, mix ingredients together until smooth. Drizzle the loaf once it has cooled.
