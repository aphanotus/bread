## Pan dei Morti (Day of the Dead Bread)

A traditional dessert baked for Day of the Dead in northern Italy. Inspired by recipes from [Lombardia Food](https://www.lombardiafood.com/pan-dei-morti/) and [Savoring Italy](https://www.savoringitaly.com/pan-dei-morti-bread-of-dead-cookies/).


### Ingredients 

- 250g flour
- 100g raisins
- 450g dry lady fingers or amaretti cookies
- 1/2 cups almonds
- 1/2 cup Nocino or another Italian liqueur, sweet white wine (passito), or orange juice 
- 100g dried figs (or use dates instead)
- 3 egg whites
- 200g sugar
- 1 tablespoon of baking soda
- 50 g unsweetened cocoa powder 
- 1 teaspoon of cinnamon
- 1/2 tsp nutneg (optional)
- 30g powdered sugar

### Procedure

- [ ] Soak raisins in water until soft, then squeeze out the excess water.
- [ ] Crush the biscuits. Peel the almonds and chop them finely with figs and other nuts (optional).
- [ ] Mix flour, baking soda and cinnamon, then add the raisins and the chopped almonds.
- [ ] Beat the egg whites to stiff peaks and add them to the other ingredients, mixing well. Pour in a half glass of white wine and keep on mixing until all the ingredients are combined.
- [ ] Let the dough sit under a cloth for 40 mins. If clumps have formed in the meantime, add some water and sugar and mix well. When the dough is uniform, divide it in two parts and give them a flattened shape. Place on a buttered baking pan.
- [ ] Preheat the oven to 350Â°F and bake the sweet bread for at least 45 minutes, until soft on the inside but with a slightly crisp surface.
- [ ] Serve warm with a sprinkle of powdered sugar on top.
