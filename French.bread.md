## French Bread

Based on the recipe in *Bread Science* by Emily Buehler. The list of ingredients is short, but making good French bread is not simple! This recipe attempts to gather advice from Buehler's book, and my own experience.

### Ingredients

Poolish

- 193 g bread  flour
- 193 g water, 100˚F
- 1/2 tsp active dried yeast

Dough

- all of the poolish
- 387 g bread flour
-  213 g water, 70˚F
- 3/4 tsp active dried yeast
- 1 3/4 tsp salt

### Procedure

For the poolish:

- [ ] Mix the yeast and warm water. Let stand for 10 min.
- [ ] Mix in the flour.
- [ ] Allow the poolish to pre-ferment for 10 to 15 hours. But remember, you want to proceed when it's at its peak, not after! If you need to, move it into the fridge or another cool space, but only after it's had a while to grow, and be sure to warm it up again after a chill.

For the dough:

- [ ] Mix the yeast and warm water. Let stand for 10 min.
- [ ] Mix in the poolish and flour. Cover and let it stand for 25 minutes. (This step allows for autolysis.)
- [ ] Add the salt.
- [ ] Knead by hand: Push the dough with the heel of your hand, then fold it back and rotate it. Repeat! Get into a rhythm. Avoid ripping the dough. It will start out very sticky, but it should soon begin to stick more to itself and become more elastic. (This is greater aided by the autolysis step.) Use a windowpane test to determine when the dough is sufficiently kneaded.
- [ ] Place the dough into a covered, oiled bowl to proof. About 1 hour in a warm spot.
- [ ] Punch down the dough. Fold it back on itself, twice, and return it to a covered, oiled bowl to proof. About 1 hour in a warm spot.

> Alternatively, either of the first two of these 1-hour, room-temperature proofs can be substituted for an overnight in the fridge. If so, allow more time (about 90 min) for the following proof.

- [ ] Again, punch down the dough. Fold it back on itself, twice, and return it to a covered, oiled bowl to proof. About 1 hour in a warm spot.
- [ ] Move the dough to a lightly floured work surface.
- [ ] Flatten the dough uniformly with the palm of your hand. Try the handle it as little as possible. 
- [ ] Shape the dough. 
  - For a boule, fold the four corners of the dough into the center. Flip it over and tuck in the edges. Round it out by gently pushing the dough back and forth with your hand on the work surface. (Your hand must be on the surface. If it's above, you'll roll the dough, which is not the intent.) Continue until the dough ball can maintain a rounded shape.
  - For a batard, stretch the dough into an oval with the long axis away from you. Fold the top third up and towards you. As you fold it down, gently push the dough up. Press the middle of the folded area with the heel of your hand. Gently rotate the dough 180˚ and repeat the folding process. Next, press the middle of the dough with the heel of your hand to form an indentation lengthwise and horizontal. Now fold the dough along that indentation. Press the seam closed with the heel of your hand. Make the final shape by gently pushing the dough back and forth with your hand on the work surface. Pull the batard towards you with your hands with the little fingers on the surface, then push it away with your heels and thumbs on the near side. During the final proof, it's helpful to brace the sides of batards with a rolled up towel.
  - For baguettes -- well, our oven can't really handle a baguette shape!
- [ ] Cover the shaped dough and let it rest for about 1 hour or until it achieves the desired shape.
- [ ] Preheat the oven to 450˚F.
- [ ] Brush the dough with water. 
- [ ] Score the dough with a lame.
- [ ] Bake for 28 min. (Crust may be improved by brushing or spraying with water after about 5 min.) Cover the bread with aluminum foil about 10 minutes into the bake. 
- [ ] Cool on a wire rack.



### Notes

- **Timing**. Plan for a long day of prep up to one of the proofs. The precise number of proofs can be increased or decreased by one, if necessary. But if you can overnight it in the fridge before the last proof, then it leaves only about 3 hours, plus the time for shaping, before the bread is ready. It may also be possible to overnight the poolish or the shaped dough. Just be sure to thoroughly warm the dough before continuing.
- **Don't use sourdough**. The first time I tried this recipe, I used sourdough starter in the poolish as about 50% of the flour/water mass. It was delicious, but everyone agreed that the sourdough flavor wasn't really the aesthetic that was best for French bread.
