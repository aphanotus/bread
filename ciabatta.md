Requires an overnight rise. Based on a receipt from the [Brown-Eyed Baker](https://www.browneyedbaker.com/ciabatta-bread/).

### Ingredients

#### For the Sponge

- 1 cup (125 g) all-purpose flour
- 1/8 teaspoon instant yeast
- 1/2 cup (125 ml) water, at room temperature

#### For the Dough

- 2 cups (250 g) all-purpose flour
- 1.5 teaspoons salt
- 1/2 teaspoon instant yeast
- 3/4 cup (187.5 ml) water, at room temperature
- 1/4 cup (61 ml) whole or 2% milk, at room temperature

### Preparation

- [ ] **Make the Sponge**. Combine the flour, yeast and water and stir. Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap and let stand at room temperature for 8-24 hours.
- [ ] **Make the Dough**. Mix the sponge and dough ingredients (flour, salt, yeast, water and milk).
- [ ] **Knead** until smooth and shiny (the dough will be very sticky).
- [ ] Transfer to a large bowl, cover tightly, and let **rise** at room temperature until doubled in size, about 1 hour.
- [ ] Using a rubber spatula, gently **fold** the dough over itself by lifting the edge of the dough toward the middle. Turn the bowl 90 degrees, and fold again. Turn the bowl and fold the dough 6 more times (for a total of 8 times).
- [ ] Cover with plastic wrap and let **rise** for 30 minutes.
- [ ] **Repeat the folding**, and let **rise** until doubled in size, about 30 minutes.
- [ ] **Preheat** the oven to 450 ˚F.
- [ ] Liberally **flour** the top of the dough and divide it in half with a bench scraper. Turn 1 piece of dough cut-side-up and dust with flour. 
- [ ] With well-floured hands, **press the dough** into a rough 12x6-inch rectangle. 
- [ ] **Fold** the shorter sides of the dough toward center, overlapping them like you would fold a letter in thirds, to form a 7x4-inch rectangle. Repeat with the second piece of dough.
- [ ] Gently transfer each loaf, seam-side-down, onto parchment, dust with flour, and cover with plastic wrap. 
- [ ] Let the loaves sit at room temperature for 30 minutes (the surface of the loaves will develop small bubbles).
- [ ] Using floured fingertips, evenly poke the entire surface of each loaf to form a 10x6-inch rectangle.
- [ ] Spray the loaves lightly with water. Slide the loaves and parchment onto a baking stone. 
- [ ] **Bake** at 450 ˚F, spraying the loaves with water twice more during the first 5 minutes of baking time, until the crust is deep golden brown and the loaves register 210˚F, 22 to 27 minutes.
- [ ] Cool on a wire rack, at least 1 hour before slicing and serving.
