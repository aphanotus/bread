Inspired by [Dylan Bachelet](https://www.instagram.com/dylanbachelet_/)’s [Gochujang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gochujang) Buns from the 2024 GBBO. Following much discussion on Reddit and elsewhere, this version uses [garlic confit](https://daenskitchen.com/garlic-confit/) and a [tangzhong](https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/blog/2018/03/26/tangzhong) milk bread base [recipe](https://www.joshuaweissman.com/post/greatest-dinner-rolls).

### Ingredients

#### tangzhong

- 2 Tbsp (20g) bread flour
- 2 Tbsp (27g) water
- 4 Tbsp (60g) whole milk

#### dough

- 2.5 cups (320g) bread flour
- 1 Tbsp (9g) active dry yeast
- 3/4 tsp (3g) fine sea salt
- 1/2 cup (120g) whole milk, room temperature
- 2.5 Tbsp gochujang
- 25g (4 cloves) drained garlic confit
- 50g granulated sugar
- 3 Tbsp (42g) unsalted butter, softened
- 1 whole egg, room temperature


### Procedure

####  tangzhong

- [ ] Add all the tangzhong  ingredients together over medium heat, and constantly whisk until it becomes a paste.
- [ ] Once thick, remove from heat and let it cool to room temperature.

#### dough

- [ ] Start the yeast in a small amount of the warm milk, and let sit for 10 minutes.
- [ ] In a stand mixer bowl, add the dry ingredients. 
- [ ] Add in the milk, yeast mixture, tangzhong, egg, gochujang and garlic confit. 
- [ ] Mix on low speed, scraping the sides occasionally. 
- [ ] When dough starts coming together, increase speed to medium-low. Gradually add butter until incorporated and nothing sticks to the sides. About 5-7 minutes.
- [ ] Dump dough onto a work surface and roll into a tight ball. 
- [ ] Place dough into a lightly greased bowl and cover. 
- [ ] Rise for 1-2 hours, or doubled in size.
- [ ] Punch the dough down and dump onto a lightly floured work surface
- [ ] Divide into equal pieces (e.g. 8 x 90 g).
- [ ] Roll dough pieces into small tight balls and place into the baking dish
- [ ] Cover and proof for 1-2 hours. 
- [ ] Brush with egg wash (a egg beaten with a splash of whole milk).
- [ ] Slice the top of each bun with a bread lame or sharp knife to produce an "ear".
- [ ] Bake in a preheated oven at 350˚F for 28-30 minutes. 
- [ ] Cool on a wire rack.

## Tips

- Tangzhong will turn to paste and then burn quickly. So wtach it!
- Weigh the dough and calculate a consistent weight to ensure that the buns are a consistent size.
- Roll the dough into buns by first pulling them into one spot for a few seconds. Then roll them in a cupped hand on top of the bench to round them up. Finally, roll them up as you edge a scraper under them, but push them along. This last motion will produce perfectly round dough balls!
