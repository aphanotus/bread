## Pane Valle Maggia

A rustic sourdough from the Lugano region of Switzerland, near Milan, Italy. Recipe from [Cusine Helvetica](https://cuisinehelvetica.com/2020/09/07/recipe-pane-valle-maggia/).

### Ingredients

Traditionally, the bread and whole wheat flour here would instead be dark flour, such as ruchmehl, farine bise, or farina bigia. What is Europe is called type 1100.

- 280 g bread flour
- 20 g whole wheat flour
- 100 g rye flour 
- 12 g salt
- 150 g sourdough starter
- 275-300 g water, lukewarm

### Instructions

- [ ] In a large bowl, whisk together the flours and salt. Make a well in the center and add the sourdough starter and lukewarm water. Then, stir all the ingredients together until a dough forms.
- [ ] On a lightly floured surface, knead the dough by hand for about 10 minutes or use an electric mixer with a dough hook, until it becomes smooth and elastic. The dough will be quite wet, so you may need to use a scraper at times if you’re kneading by hand.
- [ ] Place the dough in a bowl lightly coated with vegetable oil. Cover tightly and let it rise for approximately 1 hour at room temperature. 
- [ ] With wet hands, pull the dough out from one side and fold it into the middle. Repeat this pull and fold method from three other sides of the dough.
- [ ] Continue to proof for about 1 hour.
- [ ] After it has risen in the bowl, place it in a round proofing basket lined with a thin cotton towel dusted with flour (rice flour works well), to prevent the dough from sticking. Let it rise at room temperature for approximately 8-10 hours. Then, place it in the refrigerator for 8–12 hours (e.g., overnight) for a long, cold rise.
- [ ] After its long cold rise, preheat your oven to 500°F. Generously sprinkle a baking sheet with flour, to prevent the bread from sticking.
- [ ] When the oven is hot, take the proofing basket out of the refrigerator and remove the cover. Gently invert the basket onto the baking sheet. 
- [ ] With a sharp knife, make three quick slash marks across the top of the dough. 
- [ ] Immediately into the hot oven to prevent the dough from deflating.
- [ ] Bake the bread at 500°F for 20 minutes and then drop the temperature to 450°F and bake for an additional 20-25 minutes. It’s ready when the bread has a dark brown exterior and sounds hollow when tapped on the bottom.
