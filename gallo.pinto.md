# Gallo Pinto

Beans and rice, a staple of the Costa Rican *tipico* breakfast. This recipe is one Serena came up with after visiting Costa Rica. The [Lizano](https://www.ticoshopping.com/collections/lizano/products/salsa-lizano-sauce-23-6-oz) and [gallo pinto seasoning](https://www.ticoshopping.com/products/gallo-pinto-seasoning-by-maggi-4pack-8g) are really important to get the flavor right. Cilantro is also a important ingredient here. Gallo pinto is usually served along side scrambled eggs, a slice of salty *queso fresco*, and fresh fruit. Many people like some extra Lizano on the table as a condiment!

Serves 8.

## Ingredients

- 1 cup Basmati rice 
- 2 Tbsp olive oil
- 3 red onions, chopped
