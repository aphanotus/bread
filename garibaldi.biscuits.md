Modified from the [recipe by Prue Leith](https://thegreatbritishbakeoff.co.uk/recipes/all/prue-leith-garibaldi-biscuits/).




#### Ingredients

- 200 g dried fruit, roughly chopped (raisins, currants or cranberries)
- 150 ml orange juice
- 225g all-purpose flour
- 2 tsp baking powder
- 0.5 tsp baking soda
- 1 tsp salt
- 125 g unsalted butter, cubed and chilled
- 45 g powdered sugar
- 2 large egg, separated

#### Method

- [ ] Place the dried fruit in a small pan with the orange juice and bring to the boil over a medium heat. 
- [ ] Reduce the heat slightly, then simmer for 5 minutes, until the fruit has softened. 
- [ ] Drain the fruit, discarding the orange juice. Spread the fruit out on a plate lined with kitchen paper to cool and remove any excess moisture.
- [ ] Whisk the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt together in a mixing bowl. 
- [ ] Add the butter and rub it into the flour with your fingertips until the mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs. Mix in the castor sugar until combined.
- [ ] Add the egg yolk and 1 tablespoon of water and mix with a table knife until the mixture comes together to form a firm dough. 
- [ ] Knead the dough very gently into a ball, then flatten it into a disc. 
- [ ] Wrap the disc and chill it for 20 minutes.
- [ ] Lightly dust the work surface with flour, cut the dough in half and roll out each piece to a 20 x 15 cm rectangle about 3 mm thick.
- [ ] Lightly brush one of the rectangles with beaten egg white, then scatter the soaked dried fruit evenly over the top. 
- [ ] Lay the second rectangle of pastry directly on top to cover.
- [ ] Dust the work surface with a little more flour, then evenly roll out the layered pastry and fruit into a 25 x 20 cm rectangle. Trim the edges neatly, then cut the rectangle lengthways in half. 
- [ ] Cut each new rectangle of pastry crossways into 6 equal biscuits (each about 9 cm long x 3.5 cm wide), to make 12 biscuits in total. 
- [ ] Prick the dough all over with a fork.
- [ ] Brush with the remaining beaten egg white.
- [ ] Place the biscuits on the lined baking tray. 
- [ ] Bake at 350ËšF for 12-15 minutes, until light golden brown. 
- [ ] Cool on a wire rack.
