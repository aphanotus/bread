Compared to ciabatta, ciriola should have smaller and more consistent alveoli and a thinner crust, described as being like an egg-shell.  

I saw mention of this bread type on [La Cucina Italiana](https://www.lacucinaitaliana.com/italian-food/italian-dishes/ciriola-roman-bread-made-in-lazio). This recipe deviates significantly from that after researching the bread with other sources. This flour mix is an American stand in for Italian type 0 W 360 flour. 



### Ingredients

#### Biga

- 215 g King Arthur bread flour
- 25 g King Arthur whole wheat flour 
- 1/2 tsp instant dry yeast
- 135 g water, room temperature

#### Dough

- 215 g King Arthur bread flour
- 25 g King Arthur whole wheat flour
- 155 g water
- 5 g (1 tsp) honey
- 1 Tbsp olive oil
- 1.5 tsp salt



### Procedure

- [ ] **Biga**: Mix the flours and yeast. Then add the water.
- [ ] Knead it just enough to incorporate all the flour. 
- [ ] Leave at room temperature (68 - 72°F) for 12–16 hours, covered with a damp cloth.
- [ ] Tear the big into small chunks.
- [ ] Mix in the water and honey to form a slurry.
- [ ] Add the flour, salt and oil.
- [ ] Knead.
- [ ] **Puntata**: Cover the dough and let it rest for 45 minutes. (This isn't a full rise, just a relaxation period.)
- [ ] **Shape**: Cut the dough into 8 equal pieces of 100 g each.
- [ ] Flatten a piece into an oval shape with your palm.
- [ ] Fold the top third down to the center and the bottom third up (like a letter).
- [ ] Roll into a 6-inch cylinder, applying pressure with your palms to taper the ends into points.
- [ ] Using the side of your hand, press a deep, long trench down the center of the roll (lengthwise).
- [ ] Fold the dough over that trench and pinch the seam shut, forming a boat shape. 
- [ ] **Proof:** Heavily flour parchment paper and arrange the rolls seam-up. Cover with a damp cloth, and allow them to rise for 60-75 minutes.

- [ ] Carefully flip the rolls onto a baking sheet so the seam is now on the bottom.
- [ ] Lame lengthwise.
- [ ] Bake at 450˚F for 15-18 minutes. Place boiling water in a pan or ramekin in the oven. 
- [ ] Cool on a wire rack.
