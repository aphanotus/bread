Inspired by [King Arthur](https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/recipes/sourdough-pizza-crust-recipe) and recommended by Alex Champion.

### Ingredients

- 227 g (1 cup) unfed/discard sourdough starter
- 150 g water (110˚F)
- 1/2 teaspoons instant yeast
- 1 teaspoon sea salt

### Procedure

- [ ] Combine all of the ingredients.
- [ ] Knead in a stand mixer for 7 min.

- [ ] Grease a bowl lightly with olive oil, and proof the dough, covered for 2-4 hours, until doubled in size.
- [ ] On a surface covered in semolina, press the dough into a pizza shape. If it resists shaping, allow it to rest for up to 15 min at a time until it achieves the desired shape.
- [ ] Gently transfer the dough to a cooking sheet, cover it, and rest for 15 min. Continue allowing it to rise to the desired thickness.
- [ ] Add pizza sauce and toppings.
- [ ] Bake at 450°F for 8 min, until the edges begin to brown.
- [ ] Remove the pizza from the oven and add cheese.
- [ ] Return it to the oven and bake for 5-7 minutes, until the cheese is melted.
