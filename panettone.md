A traditional Italian bread from Christmas, although everyone loves this bread year round. It works for breakfast or as a dessert. Goes well with cream cheese or butter. Modified from the recipe by [the brown-eyed baker](https://www.browneyedbaker.com/panettone-recipe/). Doing this right takes 3 days, so plan ahead!

### Ingredients

- 1 cup dried fruit, such as golden and regular raisins, dates, or dried apricots
- 0.5 cup golden rum
- 2/3 cup (100 g) candied orange peel
- 3.75 cups (468.75 g) all-purpose flour
- 2/3 cup (133.33 g) granulated sugar
- 1/2 tsp active dry yeast
- 1/2 tsp salt
- zest of half a medium lemon
- 1/2 tsp vanilla extract
- 3 eggs, at room temperature
- 2/3 cup (166.67 ml) tepid water
- 1 tablespoon honey
- 10.5 Tbsp unsalted butter, softened
- 1 Tbsp unsalted butter, melted
- 1 Tbsp unsalted butter, chilled

### Preparation

#### Day 1: Fruit

- [ ] In a small bowl, combine the dried fruit with the rum and a few Tbsp hot water. Soak at room temperature, stirring occasionally, overnight or until raisins are plump and most of the liquid has been absorbed.
- [ ] Clean and cut orange peel into strips about 2 cm by 3 mm. (A [channel knife](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYtUR4zZMdk) makes this easy!) Boil them in a saturated sugar solution until they become soft and translucent ([candied citron](https://www.aspicyperspective.com/the-easiest-candied-orange-peel-recipe/)).

> Most of the candied citron should go into the bread, but save some attractive peices to decorate the top of the loaf after baking.

#### Day 2: Prove

- [ ] Combine the dry ingredients: flour, sugar, yeast, salt, and lemon zest. 
- [ ] In another bowl, whisk together the eggs, tepid water, vanilla extract and honey. 
- [ ] Mix the egg mixture into the flour mixture. 
- [ ] Add the softened butter, a few tablespoons at a time, mixing thoroughly before adding more. 
- [ ] Mix until the dough is smooth and elastic.
- [ ] Decant the rum from the dried fruit and stir the fruit together with the candied citron and 1 Tbsp of melted butter. Stir this mixture into the dough.

> The fruit-infused rum is delicious! It will have a flavor like port.

- [ ] Place the dough in a large, covered bowl to rise overnight (8-12 hours). It should nearly tripled in volume.

#### Day 3: Bake

- [ ] After the first rise, turn the dough out onto a work surface and gently shape it into a round loaf. 
- [ ] Transfer to a large spring-form pan. Using cooking spray or line the pan with parchment paper.
- [ ] Cover with plastic or a damp  towel and let the dough rise again in a warm place. The dough will not rise much in the oven, so look for it to have its final shape, rising just above the top of the mold. This may take 3 to 5 hours.
- [ ] If desired, score the surface of the loaf, and place the chilled tablespoon of butter in the center of the mark. 
- [ ] Bake at 360˚F for 75 to 90 minutes. Check bread at about 40 minutes and cover loosely with aluminum foil to prevent over-browning of the top.

> We have struggled to optimize the baking time and temperature. The [orginal recipe](https://www.browneyedbaker.com/panettone-recipe/) calls for 60-75 min at 370˚F, but we find this leaves the interior uncooked. The good news is that this recipe is pretty forgiving.

- [ ] Turn the bread out on a rack to cool.
