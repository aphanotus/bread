## Panettone

![](https://i.imgur.com/u0plbkI.jpg)

A traditional Italian bread from Christmas, although everyone loves this bread year round. It works for breakfast or as a dessert. Goes well with cream cheese or butter. 

This recipe has evolved with influences from [the brown-eyed baker](https://www.browneyedbaker.com/panettone-recipe/), and [Sally Vargas](https://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/panettone/). 

Doing this right takes several days, so plan ahead!

### Ingredients

**for the dough**

- 465 g all-purpose flour
- 112 g sugar (24.1%)
- 1 tsp yeast
- 1 tsp salt
- 0.5 tsp vanilla extract
- 2 eggs
- 2 egg yolks
- 75 g milk (16.1%)
- 115 g water (24.7%)
- 25 g honey (5.4%)
- 144 g unsalted butter, softened (not melted) (31.0%)
- 1 Tbsp unsalted butter, refrigerated
- zest of 1 orange

**fruit and nut filling**

- 144 g dried fruit, such as golden and regular raisins, currants, dates, or dried apricots (31.0%)
- 0.5 cup golden rum to soak the dried fruit
- 75 g candied orange peel (16.1%)
- 45 g slivered almonds (8.6%)



### Preparation

#### Soak the fruit (Day 1)

- [ ] In a small bowl, combine the dried fruit with the rum and a few Tbsp hot water. Soak at room temperature, stirring occasionally, overnight or until raisins are plump and most of the liquid has been absorbed.
- [ ] Wash and cut orange peel into long thin strips (about 2 cm by 3 mm). A [channel knife](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eYtUR4zZMdk) makes this easy! Boil them in a saturated sugar solution until they become soft and translucent ([candied citron](https://www.aspicyperspective.com/the-easiest-candied-orange-peel-recipe/)).

#### Start the *biga* (Day 1)

- [ ] In a stand-mixer bowl, add the yeast to the warm water (115 g). 
- [ ] Wait 10 minutes, then mix in 100 g flour.
- [ ] Cover and let rise overnight (10-16 hours).

#### Prep the dough (Day 2)

- [ ] Set the stand mixer on medium speed with the mixing paddle, and add the egg yolks one at a time, until each is incorporated. 

- [ ] Continue at medium speed and add the orange zest, sugar, honey, salt and vanilla.

- [ ] Reduce to low speed and gradually add the remaining flour until blended. You may need to scrape the sides of the bowl.

- [ ] Switch to the dough hook. Knead on low speed for 8 minutes, or until the dough is very smooth and elastic. Stop 2 or 3 times to push down any dough that creeps up on the dough hook.

- [ ] With the mixer on low speed, gradually add the butter, a few tablespoons at a time, until it is incorporated. Continue to mix with the dough hook for 3 minutes until the dough is silky and shiny.

> If it still seems extremely sticky, gradually add from 1 to 4 tablespoons additional flour. The dough should be very soft and still sticky and will just barely pull away from the sides of the bowl, but not the bottom.

- [ ] Cover and proof. Use a relatively low room temperature for several hours or refrigerate for up to 2 days.

#### Bake the Panettone (Day 2 or 3)

- [ ] Decant the rum from the soaked fruit. 

> The fruit-infused rum is delicious! It will have a flavor like port.

- [ ] Turn the dough out onto a well-floured workspace and roll it into a flat rectangle. Spread the drained fruit and the almonds evenly over the dough. 
- [ ] With a rolling pin, roll forcefully over the fruit and nuts to embed them into the dough.
- [ ] Fold the long sides of the fruit-covered dough into thirds (like a letter). You will end up with a rectangle. Then fold the bottom half of the rectangle to meet the top to form a square. Pat the square to a thickness of about 4 cm. Bring the corners into the center to form a ball, and pinch the loose ends together. Cup your hands around the dough to round the ball.
- [ ] Place the dough with the seam-side down inside the panettone mold (or use a well-greased spring-form pan). Cover and let it rise in a warm place for about 2 hours, or until the dough reaches the top edge of the mold. 
- [ ] When the dough has risen, use a sharp, serrated knife to score the surface with a shallow cross from edge to edge. Place a cold 1 Tbsp pat of butter in the center of the dough.
- [ ] Set the oven to 325°F. Bake for 30 minutes. Then place a piece of foil loosely over the top to keep it from browning too much. Continue to bake for 40 to 45 minutes, or until golden brown and a thermometer registers 195°F. 
- [ ] Allow it to cool upside-down. If using a panettone paper mold, just skewer the loaf and suspend it in large pot. If using a spring-loaf pan, stack the edges of the pan on other objects and allow the panettone to cool while hanging.
