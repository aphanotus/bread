## Anise & Orange Biscotti

Based on the recipe by [Eileen Gray](https://www.baking-sense.com/2017/10/24/anise-orange-biscotti/)

### Ingredients

- 4 large eggs (plus 1 for egg wash)
- 36 g olive oil
- 1 teaspoon vanilla
- zest of 2 large oranges
- 2 tablespoons of dark rum
- 400 g all purpose flour
- 30 g corn meal
- 200 g granulated sugar
- 1 tablespoon baking powder
- ½ teaspoon table salt
- 1 tablespoon anise seeds
- 160 g chopped, toasted almonds

### Instructions
- [ ] In a small bowl combine the wet ingredients (eggs, olive oil, vanilla, zest and rum). Set aside. 
- [ ] In a mixing bowl combine the dry ingredients (flour, corn meal, sugar, baking powder, salt, and anise seed -- but not the almonds). Whisk to combine.
- [ ] Add the wet to the dry ingredients and mix until almost combined. 
- [ ] Add the almonds and mix to until almost combined. 
- [ ] Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and finish mixing by hand.
- [ ] Cover the dough and rest for 15-20 minutes. Preheat the oven to 350 °F. Line a ½ sheet pan with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat.
- [ ] Split the dough into 2 equal portions. Use your hands to roll each piece of dough to a 13" x 2" log. 
- [ ] Set the logs onto the sheet pan, leaving at least 3" between them. Brush each log with egg wash. Optionally  sprinkle with 2 tablespoons of granulated sugar.
- [ ] Bake until golden brown and feels firm when pressed in the middle, about 35 minutes. Cool completely.
- [ ] Use a serrated knife to cut each log into 2-cm slices. Lay the cookies flat on the sheet pans and bake 10-15 minutes until golden brown. Flip them and bake on the other side for another 10-15 minutes. Cool on a wire rack.
