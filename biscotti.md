## Anise & Orange Biscotti

Based on the recipe by [Eileen Gray](https://www.baking-sense.com/2017/10/24/anise-orange-biscotti/)

### Ingredients

- 4 large eggs (plus 1 for egg wash)
2 oz olive oil (¼ cup)
1 teaspoon vanilla
2 large oranges (finely grated zest)
1 oz dark rum (2 tablespoons)
16 oz all purpose flour (3 ¼ cups, see note)
1 ½ oz corn meal (¼ cup)
12 oz granulated sugar (1 ½ cups)
1 tablespoons baking powder
½ teaspoon table salt
1 tablespoon anise seeds
12 oz toasted almonds (2 cups, roughly chopped)
Instructions
In a small bowl combine the 4 large eggs, 2 oz olive oil, 1 teaspoon vanilla, finely grated zest from 2 large oranges and 1 oz dark rum, set aside. In a mixing bowl combine 16 oz all purpose flour, 1 ½ oz corn meal, 12 oz granulated sugar, 1 tablespoons baking powder, ½ teaspoon table salt, and 1 tablespoon anise seeds. Mix the dry ingredients for 30 seconds to combine.
Add the egg mixture to the dry ingredients and mix until almost combined. Add 12 oz toasted almonds and mix to until almost combined. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and finish mixing by hand.
Cover the dough with plastic wrap and allow it to rest for 15-20 minutes. Preheat the oven to 350 °F. Line a ½ sheet pan with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat.
Split the dough into 2 equal portions. Use your hands to roll each piece of dough to a 13" x 2" log. Set the logs onto the sheet pan, leaving at least 3" between them. Brush each log with egg wash and sprinkle with 2 tablespoons of sugar.
Bake until golden brown and feels firm when pressed in the middle, about 35 minutes. Allow the cookies to cool completely.
Use a serrated knife to cut each log into ¾" slices on a slight diagonal. Lay the cookies flat on the sheet pans and bake 10-15 minutes until toasty and golden brown (see note). Flip the cookies over and bake on the other side for another 10-15 minutes. Cool on a wire rack.
Store in a cookie jar for up to 2 weeks.
Notes
If measuring the flour by volume use the “dip & sweep” method. That is, dip the measuring cup into the flour bin, overfill it, then sweep away the excess.
If you like your biscotti super-crunchy bake the sliced cookies for the longer time, bake for the shorter time if you like them a little softer.
To work ahead: the dough logs can be wrapped and refrigerated for several days or frozen for several weeks.
