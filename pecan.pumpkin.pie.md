![](images/pumpkin.pie.with.pecans.jpeg)

Inspired by the popular Thanksgiving mash-up. Based on the old One-Pie recipe. 

### Ingredients

#### Pumpkin filling

- 284 g ONE-PIE pumpkin puree (about two-thirds of a 15-oz can)
- 2 tsp cornstarch
- 142 g brown sugar
- 30 g  molasses
- 2 eggs (1 whole & 1 yolk, beaten -- save the egg white)
- 255 g evaporated milk (about two-thirds of a 12-oz can)
- 5 g melted butter (about 1/3 Tbsp)
- 1/4 tsp cinnamon
- 1/2 tsp ginger
- 1/2 tsp nutmeg
- 1/2 tsp salt

#### Candied Pecans

- pecans (choose attractive whole pecan halves, enough to cover the surface of the pie)
- 1 egg white
- 1 Tbsp water
- 1/4 cup granulated sugar
- 1/4 tsp salt


### Instructions

#### Bake the crust

- [ ] Preheat the oven to 375°F . 
- [ ] Remove the pie dough from the refrigerator and roll it into a round that’s at least 13" in diameter and about 1/8" thick. Transfer to a 9" pie pan. Crimp as desired. 
- [ ] Line the crust with foil or parchment and fill it with pie weights. Place the crust on a baking sheet and bake according to the crust recipe's specs. The edges of the crust should be very light golden in color. 
- [ ] Remove the crust from the oven and carefully remove the weights. Dock the bottom lightly with a fork and cover the rim with aluminum foil. Return the crust to the oven and bake for another 10 to 15 minutes, or until the bottom turns light golden brown and no longer looks wet. 

*While the crust prebakes, prepare the pumpkin filling.* 

#### Pumpkin filling

- [ ] Combine all the pumpkin filling ingredients and whisk to combine. Set aside. 
- [ ] When the crust is done baking, remove it from the oven and pour the pumpkin filling into the crust (no need for it to cool first). It won't fill the crust; that’s OK. 
- [ ] Return the pie to the oven, still on the baking sheet with the pie crust shield or foil around the edges, and bake for 45 to 50 minutes. The filling is done when it just barely wobbles when you tap or lightly shake the pan. It’s OK if the very center of the filling looks a little wet. 
- [ ] Remove the pie from the oven and allow it to cool for 15 minutes at room temperature while you prepare the pecans. The pumpkin filling should set during this time. 

#### Candied Pecans

- [ ] Mix the sugar and salt in a small bowl.
- [ ] Whisk egg white and water together in a large bowl until frothy.
- [ ] Toss pecans in the egg white mixture to coat.
- [ ] Add the sugar mixture and gently stir until pecans are evenly coated.
- [ ] Spread onto a lined baking sheet.
- [ ] Bake at 250˚F. Flip or stir the pecans every 10 minutes, cooking for a total of about 45 to 50 minutes.

#### Assembly

- [ ] Arrange the candied pecans on the pie.
- [ ] Store refrigerated. Warm before serving.
