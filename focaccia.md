Easy and delicious. Goes really well with any improvised [tapas](https://www.google.com/search?q=olive+caper+tapas+recipe). Based on the [recipe from @gimmesomeoven](https://www.gimmesomeoven.com/rosemary-focaccia-bread/).

### Ingredients

- 1 1/3 cups water, warmed to 110˚F (use a thermometer)
- 2 tsp honey
- 2 1/4 tsp active dry yeast
- 3 1/2 cups flour (all-purpose or bread flour)
- 1/3 cup extra virgin olive oil
- 2 tsp flaky sea salt
- 2 sprigs fresh rosemary (or substitute almost any topping)

### Preparation

- [ ] **Start the yeast.** Mix yeast, warm water and honey in a large mixing bowl. Let stand for 5-10 min, until foamy.
- [ ] **Knead the dough.** Gradually stir in the flour, olive oil and salt until a shaggy dough begins to form. Then turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead by hand for 5 minutes until smooth, adding extra flour if the dough feels too sticky
- [ ] **First rise.** Shape the dough into a ball and place it in a greased mixing bowl, and cover. Let the dough rest in a warm location for 45-60 minutes, or until it has doubled in size.
- [ ] **Second  rise.** Shape the dough into a large circle or rectangle until that the dough is about 1/2-inch thick. Cover and let the dough continue to rise for another 20 minutes.
- [ ] **Prepare the dough.** Heat oven to 400°F. Transfer the dough to a large parchment-covered baking sheet (or press it into a 9 x 13-inch baking dish). Use your fingers to poke deep dents — all the way down  — all over the surface of the dough. Then brush olive oil evenly all over the top of the dough, and sprinkle evenly with the fresh rosemary needles and sea salt.
- [ ] **Bake** for 20 minutes, or until the dough is slightly golden and cooked through.

### Variations

**Roasted garlic**: Peel 1/4 cup of garlic cloves. Place in a packet of foil and drizzle with olive oil (optionally also salt and pepper). Bake at 400˚F for 30 min. Roughly chop and top the Focaccia dough before it's baked.

**Za'atar**: Add 2 Tbsp Za'atar to the dough. Sprinkle liberally on top before it goes into the oven.
