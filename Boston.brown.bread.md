I grew up with this stuff! A steamed bread with a strong molasses flavor. It's delicious with cream cheese!

### Ingredients

- One metal 6-inch tall by 4-inch diameter coffee can. Ideally use one with a ring at the top, or remove the ring with a smooth-edge can opener.
- Butter for greasing 
- 60 g (1/2 cup) all-purpose flour
- 60 g (1/2 cup) rye flour
- 60 g (1/2 cup) finely ground corn meal (must be finely ground)
- 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 teaspoon allspice
- 1/4 tsp cinnamon
- 140 g (1/2 cup) molasses
- 225 g (1 cup) buttermilk
- 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract (optional)
- 60 g (about 1/3 cup) raisins, boiled
- 60 g (about 1/3 cup) dates, chopped

### Preparation

- [ ] Set a steamer rack inside a tall stockpot. Fill the pot with enough water to come 1/3 of the way up the sides of the coffee can. Turn the burner on to medium as you work.
- [ ] Grease the coffee can with butter.
- [ ] Boil the raisins for 1 minute. Drain and cool.
- [ ] Mix the dry ingredients in a large bowl. Whisk together. 
- [ ] Add the raisins and dates and stir to coat them.
- [ ] In another bowl, mix together the wet ingredients. Whisk in the molasses.
- [ ] Pour the wet ingredients into the dry and stir well with a spoon.
- [ ] Pour batter into the can. Taking care that the batter not reach higher than 2/3 up the sides of the container.
- [ ] Cover the can tightly with foil.
- [ ] Steam the bread on the stovetop for at least 2 hours and 15 minutes. Check to see if the bread is done by inserting a toothpick into it. If the toothpick comes out clean, you're ready. If not, re-cover the pan and cook for up to another 45 minutes.
- [ ] Let the bread cool for 1 hour before turning out of the container.
- [ ] Slice and eat plain, or toast in a little butter in a frying pan.
