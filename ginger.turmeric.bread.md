I've made this bread several times. It's easy and gets attention becuase of the bright color. Rowan loves this bread! Note that this is bread with ginger, not gingerbread. The recipe is inspired by one from [Epicurious](https://www.epicurious.com/recipes/member/views/ginger-turmeric-yeast-bread-52714511). 

### Ingredients

- 360 g (3 cups) bread flour
- 1.5 tsp yeast
- 1.5 tsp salt
- 1 tsp sugar
- 1 tsp turmeric
- 1 tsp ginger, freshly minced
- 355 g (1.5 cups) water

### Preparation

- [ ] Combine all the dry ingredients in a bowl and stir. 

- [ ] Mince the ginger. 
- [ ] Add 1.5 cups of water and mix. 
- [ ] If the dough is still dry, add a little water until it becomes wortable. 
- [ ] Knead the dough a bit.
- [ ] Add the ginger and continue kneading, until it passes the [windowpane test](https://www.thekitchn.com/bakers-techniques-how-to-do-th-70784).

- [ ] Cover the dough and let it rise 2 to 14 hours. 
- [ ] After the first rise, turn the dough out onto a work surface and gently shape it into a round loaf. Don't knead it at this stage. 
- [ ] Transfer to a loaf pan lined with parchment paper.
- [ ] Let the loaf rise for about 2 hours. Don't let it over rise!
- [ ] Bake at 400˚F for about 40 minutes, or until the interior temperature reaches 210˚F. Check bread at about 20 minutes and cover loosely with aluminum foil to prevent over-browning of the top.
- [ ] Turn the bread out on a rack to cool.

### Variations

#### Everything Bread

Instead of ginger and turmeric, this recipe worked great with 1 Tbsp of Everything Bagel seasoning. It can be baked right in. A bit extra can garnish the top. This mix already contains salt, so it might be healthier to reduce the salt if using Everything. Last baked 18 March 2022.

#### Twist

The two versions can also be twisted together. Reduce the scale to 2 cups of flour for each dough. I had each kid make their favorite.

**Ingredients (for each dough)**
- 2 cups bread flour
- 1/4 tsp yeast
- 1 tsp salt
- 1 tsp sugar
- 1 cup water

for the Ginger/Turmeric dough

- 3/4 tsp turmeric
- 3/4 tsp ginger, freshly minced

for the Everything dough

- 2 tsp Everything bagel seasoning

Initial prove 2 hours. The gently stretch them out and twist one another the other. We moved into a round spring-form pan for the second prove of about 3 hours. Baked at 400˚F for 35 min.
