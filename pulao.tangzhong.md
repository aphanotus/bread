# Kabuli Pulao Tangzhong

Years ago I remember being amazed by Kubali Pulao in an Afghani restaurant. While the breads of that region tend to be unleavened, I wanted to try getting the rich flavor of spices, carrots and raisins into a soft tangzhong milk bread. 



### Infused Tangzhong

- **20g** Bread Flour
- **100g** Whole Milk
- **Pinch of Saffron threads** (crushed)
- **3 Green Cardamom pods** (cracked open)

**Instructions:** 

1. Combine milk, saffron, and cardamom in a small pan. Heat gently until it just begins to simmer, then turn off the heat and let it steep for 10 minutes. 
2. Strain out the cardamom pods. 
3. Whisk in 20g of flour while cooking over medium-low heat. Whisk constantly, until it becomes a thick paste. 
4. Let it cool to room temperature.



### Dough

- **260g** Bread Flour
- **70g** Whole Wheat Flour (20%)
- **7g** Instant Yeast (2 tsp)
- **40g** Granulated Sugar
- **6g** Fine Sea Salt
- **1 Large Egg** (room temperature)
- **40g** Unsalted Butter (very soft)
- **40-50ml** Room temp milk

**Instructions:**

1. In a stand mixer, combine flours, yeast, sugar, and salt.
2. Add the cooled Tangzhong, the egg, and half the remaining milk. Mix with the dough hook. If it's too dry, add the remaining milk.
3. Once a shaggy dough forms, add the soft butter one tablespoon at a time.
4. Knead on medium speed for 8-10 minutes until the dough is smooth and passes the "windowpane test."
5. Cover and let rise in a warm spot until doubled (about 60-90 mins).



### Filling

*While the dough rises, prepare this so it can cool completely.*

- **150g** Carrots (finely grated)
- **30g** Unsalted Butter
- **40g** Light Brown Sugar
- **1/2 tsp** Ground Cumin
- **1/4 tsp** Ground Cardamom
- **1/4 tsp** Ground Cinnamon
- **50g** Raisins
- **30g** Slivered Almonds (toasted)

**Instructions:**

1. Steep the raisins in freshly brewed black or Earl Grey tea for 15 minutes.
2. If needed, toast the almond slivers.
3. Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add the grated carrots and sauté for 5 minutes until soft.
4. Stir in sugar and spices. Strain the soaked raisins and add them. The carrots and raisins will release liquid; keep cooking until that liquid evaporates and the carrots look jammy and dark orange.
5. Stir in the raisins and almonds. Remove from heat and **cool completely**. (Warm filling will melt your dough!)



### Assembly & Baking

1. On a floured surface, roll the dough into a 12x16 inch rectangle.
2. **Spread:** Spread the carrot mixture evenly, leaving a 1-inch border at the edges.
3. **Roll & Cut:** Roll the dough tightly into a log (starting from the long side). Use a sharp knife (or dental floss) to slice the log in half lengthwise, exposing all those beautiful orange layers.
4. **Twist:** Lay the two halves side-by-side, cut-side up. Cross them over each other repeatedly to form a "braid" or twist.
5. **Final Rise:** Gently lift the twist into a greased 9x5 loaf pan. Cover and let rise for 45-60 minutes until puffy.
6. **Bake:** Preheat oven to **350°F (175°C)**. Brush the top with an egg wash and sprinkle with kalonji (nigella) seeds. Bake for **30-35 minutes** until the internal temperature is 190°F.
7. **Finishing touch:** After it cools, brush the top with a tiny bit of melted butter mixed with honey.
