### Procedure

####  tangzhong

- [ ] Add all the tangzhong ingredients together over medium heat, and constantly whisk until it becomes a paste.
- [ ] Once thick, remove from heat and let it cool to room temperature.

#### dough

Follow these steps in parallel for the dark and light doughs. Start the dark dough first, since it should need a little more time to rise.

- [ ] Start the yeast in a small amount of the warm milk, and let sit for about 10 minutes.
- [ ] In a stand mixer bowl, add the dry ingredients. 
- [ ] Add in the milk, yeast mixture, tangzhong, egg and molasses (for the dark dough). 
- [ ] Mix on low speed, scraping the sides occasionally. 
- [ ] When the dough starts coming together, increase the speed to medium-low. Gradually add butter until incorporated and nothing sticks to the sides. About 5-7 minutes.
- [ ] Dump the dough onto a work surface and roll into a tight ball. 
- [ ] Place dough into a lightly greased bowl and cover. 
- [ ] Rise for 1-2 hours, or doubled in size.
- [ ] Punch the dough down and dump onto a lightly floured work surface.
- [ ] Gently roll the dough out to 10 mm (3/8 inch). Form a rectangle with the short edge being 8 inches (20 cm). Do this for both doughs. 
- [ ] Lay the dark dough on top of the light and gently roll it up.
- [ ] Transfer to a greased loaf pan (8.5 x 4.5 inches).
- [ ] Cover and proof for 1-2 hours. 
- [ ] Brush with egg wash (a egg beaten with a splash of whole milk) and decorate with caraway seeds.
- [ ] Slice the top of loaf with a bread lame or sharp knife.
- [ ] Bake in a preheated oven at 350ËšF for 30-35 minutes. 
- [ ] Cool on a wire rack.
