## Whole Wheat and Oat Pie Crust

This recipe is for a 9-inch pie pan.

### Ingredients

- 75 g whole wheat pastry flour
- 50 g instant oat meal
- 50 g nut meal  (or pulsed nuts, such as  almonds, walnuts, or pecans)
- 35 g brown sugar
- 3 g (0.5 tsp) salt
- 80 g oil (canola or grapeseed) OR 80 g frozen, grated Smart Balance
- about 20 g cold water

### Instructions

- [ ] **Preheat Oven:** Preheat your oven to 375˚F.
- [ ] **Combine Dry Ingredients:** In a large bowl, whisk together the whole wheat flour, rolled oats, ground nuts, brown sugar, cinnamon, and salt. Ensure all ingredients are evenly distributed.
- [ ] **Add Fat:** Pour the liquid oil over the dry mixture. Use a fork or a pastry blender to mix it until the mixture resembles coarse, wet sand. Everything should be evenly moistened.
- [ ] **Add Water:** Add **1 tablespoon** of cold water. Mix lightly. If the mixture is still too crumbly to hold its shape when pinched, add the second tablespoon of water. **Stop adding water as soon as the mixture holds together.**
- [ ] **Press the Crust:** Pour the entire mixture into a standard 9-inch pie plate. Using the back of a spoon or the bottom of a measuring cup, firmly press the crust mixture evenly over the bottom and up the sides of the pie plate. Be careful not to make the sides too thin.
- [ ] **Chill:** Place the pie plate in the freezer for **15 minutes** to help the crust set before baking. This prevents shrinkage.
- [ ] **Bake:**
   - **If your filling is baked (e.g., pumpkin, pecan):** Bake the empty crust for **10-12 minutes** until it is just set and lightly toasted. Remove and let cool before adding the filling.
   - **If your filling is no-bake (e.g., cream, pudding):** Bake the empty crust for **15-18 minutes** until it is golden brown. Let cool completely before adding the filling.
