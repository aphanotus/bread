### Ingredients

#### tangzhong

- 71 g water
- 71 g whole milk
- 25 g bread flour

#### dough

- 495 g bread flour
- 21 g dried milk powder
- 11 g sea salt
- 1 Tbsp active dried yeast
- 170 g whole milk, room temperature
- 2 whole eggs, room temperature
- 5 Tbsp (70 g) unsalted butter, softened
- 28 g  poppy seeds

#### filling

- 142 g granulated sugar
- zest of 2 lemons
- 2 Tbsp (28 g) unsalted butter, softened

#### glaze

- 227 g (2 cups) confectioners' sugar
- pinch of table salt
- 28 g (2 Tbsp) butter, melted
- 1/2 tsp vanilla extract
- juice of 2 lemons


### Procedure

####  tangzhong

- [ ] Add all the tangzhong ingredients together over medium heat, and constantly whisk until it becomes a paste.
- [ ] Once thick, remove from heat and let it cool to room temperature.

#### dough

- [ ] Start the yeast in the warm milk, and let sit for 10 minutes (ideally before starting the tangzhong).
- [ ] Mix the tangzhong with the remaining dough ingredients until everything comes together. Let the dough rest, covered, for 20 minutes.
- [ ] Knead the dough until it is smooth, elastic, somewhat sticky.
- [ ] Shape the dough into a ball, and let it rest in a lightly greased covered bowl for 60 to 90 minutes, until puffy but not necessarily doubled in bulk.
- [ ] Gently punch the dough down; place on a work surface. 
- [ ] Divide it in half, and shape each piece into a rough rectangle. Roll each piece into an 18" x 8" rectangle.

#### filling

- [ ] Zest and then juice the lemons.
- [ ] Combine the sugar and lemon zest.
- [ ] Spread the softened butter evenly over the dough rectangles.
- [ ] Sprinkle the lemon zest mixture evenly over the dough.
- [ ] Starting with a long edge, roll the dough into a log. 
- [ ] With the seam underneath, cut the log into slices, 1 1/2" thick. Use string or dental floss to make the cut (not a knife).
- [ ] Lightly grease a 9" x 13" pan. Space the rolls in the pan.
- [ ] Cover the pan and let the rolls rise for 45 to 60 minutes, until they're crowding one another and are quite puffy. (Or let them rise overnight in a refrigerator.)
- [ ] Bake in a preheated oven at 350˚F for 22-25 minutes. Interior temperature should be about 188°F, despite little obvious browning.

#### glaze

- [ ] Stir together the icing ingredients, adding just enough of the lemon juice to make a thick spreadable glaze. Add water if more liquid is necessary.
- [ ] Remove the rolls from the oven, and turn them out of the pan onto a wire rack. Spread them with the icing; it'll partially melt into the rolls.
- [ ] Serve the rolls warm. 



## Tips

- Tangzhong will turn to paste and then burn quickly. So wtach it!
- Measure the rolled dough log to ensure that each piece is a consistent size.
