Last made February 7, 2022.

Inspired by recipes from Mark Bitteman's *How to Cook Everything* and the [New York Times Cooking section](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/7199-my-favorite-challah).

### Ingredients

- 5 cups all-purpose flour
- 2 tsp salt
- 2.5 tsp active dry yeast
- 1 Tbsp honey
- 1/4 cup sugar
- 3 eggs, plus 1 yolk
- 1 1/3 cups warm milk
- poppy or sesame seeds for sprinkling

> Bitteman uses only honey for sweetness, while the NYT recipe uses about twice this amount of sugar. Consider it a matter of taste. Bitteman's recipe also includes saffron.

### Preparation

- [ ] (Optional) Start the yeast in some warm water, with about 1 tsp sugar.
- [ ] Combine the flour, salt and yeast (if dry).
- [ ] In another bowl, whisk 3 eggs, honey, and remaining sugar and water/milk. (Save the 4^th^ yolk for an egg wash later.)
- [ ] Slowly mix the wet solution into the dry ingredients to create the dough.
- [ ] Knead the dough. It should not be too wet.
- [ ] Transfer the dough to a bowl, cover, and prove at least 1 hour or until it has doubled in size.
- [ ] Knock back the dough and cut it into 3 equal pieces. Shape each into a ball.
- [ ] Rest 15 min. 
- [ ] Roll each dough ball into a rope about 14 inches long.
- [ ] Braid the strands. 

- [ ] Transfer to a large spring-form pan.
- [ ] Rest 30 min, while the oven pre-heats.
- [ ] Beat the egg yolk with 1 tsp water and brush onto the top of the loaf.
- [ ] Sprinkle with poppy or seasame seeds.
- [ ] Bake at 375˚F for 45 min, or until an internal temperature of 200˚F. 

- [ ] Turn the bread out to cool on a rack.
