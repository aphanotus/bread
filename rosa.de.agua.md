## Ecuadorian-Style Knotted Rolls (Rosa de Agua)



This recipe produces a soft, slightly sweet bread with a light crumb. The key to making it a "rosa de agua" is the shaping technique.

**Ingredients**

- 2 teaspoons active dry yeast
- 1 cup warm milk
- ¼ cup sugar
- 4 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 2 eggs
- 4 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened

**Instructions**

1. **Activate the Yeast:** In a small bowl, stir the yeast and sugar into the warm milk. Let it sit for 5-10 minutes, or until a foamy layer forms on top.
2. **Combine Dry Ingredients:** In a large bowl, whisk together the flour and salt.
3. **Mix Wet Ingredients:** In a separate bowl, whisk the eggs. Add the foamy yeast mixture and the softened butter to the eggs and mix well.
4. **Create the Dough:** Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients. Stir until a rough, shaggy dough forms.
5. **Knead:** Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Knead for 10-15 minutes by hand until the dough is smooth, elastic, and no longer sticky.
6. **First Rise:** Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover with a clean towel, and let it rise in a warm place for 1 to 1.5 hours, or until it has doubled in size.
7. **Shape the Knots:** Gently punch down the dough and divide it into 12 to 16 equal pieces. Roll each piece into a long rope, about 10-12 inches (25-30 cm) long.
   - **To make the knot:** Take a rope and form a simple knot. You can do this by tying it just as you would tie a shoelace, but without pulling it tight. Leave the ends a little loose so the knot has room to expand as it rises.
   - Place the finished knotted rolls on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.
8. **Second Rise:** Cover the rolls and let them rise for another 30-45 minutes. They should look puffy.
9. **Preheat Oven:** While the rolls are rising, preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).
10. **Bake:** Bake for 15-20 minutes, or until the tops are a light golden brown. Let them cool slightly on a wire rack before serving.
