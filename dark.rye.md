## Dark Rye Bread

![](https://i.imgur.com/JFIbPVs.jpg)

This recipe is light on the rye and heavy on cocoa powder and mollasses. It does not have the classic caraway seed flavor of rye bread. But it tastes great! Inspired by [Simply Recipes](https://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/georges_light_rye_bread/) and [Jo Cooks](https://www.jocooks.com/recipes/dark-rye-bread/).

Last baked March 5, 2022. - I liked it, but Serena suggested the cocoa powder was too much and made it a bit bitter. In the future, I might cut the cocoa and/or add more molasses or sugar to sweeten it.

### Ingredients

- 1.5 tablespoon active dry yeast
- 2 cups water, lukewarm
- 3 tablespoon molasses
- 1/4 cup cocoa powder 
- 1.5 teaspoon salt
- 2 tablespoon vegetable oil
- 1.5 cups rye flour
- 3 cups all-purpose flour
- cornmeal for dusting

### Preparation

- [ ] **Proof the yeast.** Mix yeast and warm water in a large mixing bowl. Let stand for 5-10 min, until foamy.
- [ ] **Add** the molasses, cocoa powder, salt, caraway seeds (optional), vegetable oil, rye flour, and about 2 1/2 cups of all purpose flour. 
- [ ] **Knead** the dough by pressing down with the heel of your hand, stretching it, turning the dough a quarter-turn, pulling the dough back toward you and then pressing and stretching again. Knead additional bread flour into the dough until it reaches the right consistency. Knead for 5-7 minutes, or until the dough is smooth and elastic.
- [ ] **First rise.** Spray a bowl and the dough (yes!) in vegetable oil. Cover and rest until it doubles in size (about 1 hour).
- [ ] **Second rise.** The second rise and bake can be done on a sheet, in a loaf pan, or in Dutch oven. Spray whatever it is, and dust with cornmeal. Punch down the dough, then form it into a ball. Transfer  to its baking vessel and let it rise 35 - 40 minutes, until doubled in size. 
- [ ] Sprinkle a bit of flour over the top. Cut a few slashes with a sharp knife.
- [ ] **Bake** at 425 FÂ° for 35-40 min. 

#### Note

**Crust will require steam**. Either bake with a pan or ramekin of water or mist the dough for the first 10 minutes of baking.
