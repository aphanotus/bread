## Pane Casereccio

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/DKtJ1hP.jpg" style="zoom: 50%;" />

The name is Italian for "homemade bread". It uses a *biga* or sourdough starter. *Biga* is a bit thicker and more elastic than [King Arthur-style sourdough starter](https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/recipes/sourdough-starter-recipe). Bread nerds refer to this as [hydration](https://truesourdough.com/sourdough-hydration-explained-what-why-how-when/) in sourdough culture, the ratio of flour to water. Italian sourdoughs use biga with around 80% hydration. This one is 78%. I've tried this recipe with *una nuova biga* and by adding to existing sourdough, which people seemed to prefer. The *biga* should incubate overnight (12-16 hours). The main proof is about 5 hours.

### A note on the breads of Italy

The recipe here is modified from one for *Pane Pugliese* by [Ciao Italianista](https://ciaoitalianista.com/recipe-pane-pugliese/). There are many rustic sourdoughs from different regions and cities in Italy, with names that translate as "bread from X". Most appear to differ only in small details of the fermentation and bake. For example, compare these recipes for [Pane di Genzano](https://www.spiceroots.com/pane-di-genzano/) and [Pane di Como](https://dawghousebakery.com/2020/11/19/recipe-pane-di-como-antico/). Sicilian breads, such as [Pagnotta del Dittaino](https://www.italianrecipebook.com/pagnotta-italian-round-bread/) and [Pane Siciliano](https://www.afamilyfeast.com/pane-siciliano-sesame-seed-sicilian-bread/), have some notable differences in ingredients and final texture. I'm also quite interested in trying [Pane Valle Maggia](https://cuisinehelvetica.com/2020/09/07/recipe-pane-valle-maggia/), also a sourdough but one that includes rye flour. It's from the Lugano region of Switzerland, near Milan, Italy, where my great-grandmother's family came from. Italy also has some very different breads, such as [ciriola](https://www.lacucinaitaliana.com/italian-food/italian-dishes/ciriola-roman-bread-made-in-lazio), a spindle-shaped roll popular in Lazio, [Pan dei Morti](https://www.lombardiafood.com/pan-dei-morti/), a sweet bread with raisins, almonds and figs traditionally made in Lombardia for Day-of-the-Dead, and [Frisella](https://anitalianinmykitchen.com/italian-friselle-recipe/), a twice-baked, bagel-shaped bread from Campania typically eaten with sliced tomatos.

### Ingredients for dough

- 5/8 tsp active dry yeast
- 50 g water (115˚F)
- 320 g water (room temperature)
- 100 g *biga* (or active sourdough starter)
- 525 g flour - Good results with 5-10% semolina
- 10 g salt

### Preparation

#### For the ***biga***

- [ ] Stir the yeast into the warm water. Wait 10 minutes.
- [ ] Mix in the remaining water and flour, stirring for 3-4 minutes.
- [ ] Cover and let rise for 6-18 hours.

#### For the dough

- [ ] Stir the yeast into the warm water in a large bowl. Wait for 10 minutes.
- [ ] Meanwhile, mix the flour and salt in another large bowl. Lightly oil a large bowl for the proof and set it aside.
- [ ] Add the remaining water and the *biga* to the yeast mixture
- [ ] Add the flour and the salt mixture one cup at a time with a wooden spoon. 
- [ ] As the dough becomes hard to stir, mix and knead by hand. The dough will become wet and sticky.
- [ ] While kneading, add flour until the dough becomes soft and elastic. (The proportions above will require a decent amount of flour to be added!) 
- [ ] Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl and let it rise until tripled, about 3 to 3.5 hours. Seal it in plastic to maintain moisture.
- [ ] After the proof, cover a work surface generously in flour. 
- [ ] Turn out the dough and cover all sides in flour.
- [ ] Shape the dough very gently by flattening it a little and fold it over once. Rotate it 90 degrees and fold it again. Flip it over and with both hands on the side, stretch the surface of the dough to make it tight. Push the stretched dough underneath together to make a ball.
- [ ] Transfer the dough onto parchment paper, cover with a cloth and let rise for about an hour.
- [ ] Preheat the oven to 450˚F. 
- [ ] Before baking, score the dough with a sharp knife or [lame](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RotTycHq-5Q). 
- [ ] Bake for 35-45 min at 450˚F until golden brown. (Be sure to cover it after about 10 min to prevent our oven from burning the top!)

Some other recipes for *Pane Casereccio* suggest baking in a Dutch oven or cast iron pan with a lid. (I first saw this in recipes for *filone*, a term that simply refers to the an elongated shape of Italian sourdough bread.) Try it at 425˚F for 45-50 min. Remove the lid after about 15 minutes.

### Variations

Add seeds!

- 70 g pumpkin seeds, chopped
- 30 g sunflower seeds, chopped
- 10 g sesame seeds

Add these to the dough before kneading. Before laming, mist the bread with water, then sprinkle extra seeds on top, or egg wash and sprinkle with sesame seeds. Be sure to cover the loaf about 10-15 min into the bake to prevent the seeds from over-cooking.
