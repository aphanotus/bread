## General tips
- **Start the yeast**. For any recipe using dry yeast, mix the yeast with warm water (110-115ËšF) and about 1 teaspoon of honey. Let it stand for 5-10 min, until foamy. This will activate the yeast.

- In most recipes, **it's possible to substitute sourdough starter for flour and water**. For example 100 g of starter can replace 50 g water and 50 g flour. Be sure to keep at least 50 g of water in the recipe to start the yeast-- and it does seem wise to keep at least some dried yeast in the bake.

- Proofing times in recipes are never very accurate. It depends hugely on temperature. Yeast will produce CO2 as they grow and rise the dough based on temperature, available sugars, and any inhibitory ingredients like salt. This process will be exponential, then plateau, causing the dough to collapse. Ideally, you want to end the proof while the yeast is still vigorous, after the dough has achieved the size you want and before any collapse. But you must consider both time and temperature. -- A [reference on proofing](https://challengerbreadware.com/bread-techniques/identifying-proofing-levels-in-baked-bread/). 

- **In our convection oven**, it's always necessary to cover bread to prevent the top from burning. Place a bread pan in the air frying basket on the bottom rung to maximize its head space.
