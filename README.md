Recipes for bread and related baked things.

## General tips
- **Start the yeast**. For any recipe using dry yeast, mix the yeast with warm water (110-115ËšF) and about 1 teaspoon of honey. Let it stand for 5-10 min, until foamy. This will activate the yeast.
- In most recipes, **it's possible to substitute sourdough starter for flour and water**. For example 100 g of starter can replace 50 g water and 50 g flour. Be sure to keep at least 50 g of water in the recipe to start the yeast-- and it does seem wise to keep at least some dried yeast in the bake.
- **In our convection oven**, it's always necessary to cover bread to prevent the top from burning. Place a bread pan in the air frying basket on the bottom rung to maximize its head space.
