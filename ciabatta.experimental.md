## Ciabatta

Based on a receipt from [Alexandra Cooks](https://alexandracooks.com/2021/06/26/how-to-make-ciabatta-bread/).

While there's a poolish in this version, it does not have an early overnight step! It also doesn't really knead the dough, instead using a "stretch and fold" technique.

Total suggested time: 3 hours

### Ingredients

#### For the Poolish

- 50 grams (about 1/3 cup) bread flour
- 1/2 teaspoon instant yeast
- 50 grams (about 1/4 cup) water, lukewarm or room temperature

#### For the Dough

- 360 grams (about 1.5 cups) water, lukewarm or room temperature
- 12 grams (about 2 teaspoons) salt, kosher or sea salt
- 450 grams (about 3.5 cups) bread flour, see notes above

### Preparation

- [ ] **Make the Poolish**. Combine the flour, yeast and water and stir. Cover and let stand at room temperature for 3-4 hours.
- [ ] **Make the Dough**. Add the water to the poolish. Add the salt and stir birefly. Add the flour and stir into a sticky ball.
- [ ] Cover and let stand for 30 minutes.
- [ ] **Stretch and fold:** With wet hands, grab one side of the dough, and pull up and to the center. Rotate the bowl a quarter turn, and repeat the grabbing and pulling. Do this until you’ve made a full circle. [[Video](https://youtu.be/H9RuCGUCIfQ)] Cover the bowl. If time permits, repeat this process three more times at 30-minute intervals for a total of 4 sets of stretches and folds over the course of two hours.  If you are short on time, know that doing just one or two sets of stretches and folds is totally fine.

- [ ] Transfer to (ideally) a straight-sided container. Cover. Let it **rise** until doubled in size. 
- [ ] Deflate the dough. Return it to the container, and let it **rise again**. (This can be done overnight in the fridge.)
- [ ] Turn the dough out onto a work surface. Sprinkle your surface lightly with flour as needed to make the dough manageable. 
- [ ] Using a bench scraper or your hands, shape the dough into a tight ball. Optionally divide the dough in half, and ball up each portion.
- [ ] **Proof:** Sprinkle the countertop liberally with flour. Place the balls top-side (smooth side) down onto the flour. The seam-side will be on top now, and it may split open — this is fine. 
- [ ] Sprinkle the top surface of the balls liberally with flour. Cover with a tea towel and let rest for 2.5 hours. 
- [ ] After 2 hours of proofing, **heat the oven to 425ºF**. 
- [ ] **Line a sheet pan with parchment paper.** When the dough has finished proofing, gently flip each ball over — I find a bench scraper to be helpful here. Then use both hands to stretch each ball out gently into a rectangular shaped “slipper”. Transfer to the prepared pan. 
- [ ] **Bake** for 20 to 25 minutes or until golden all around.
- [ ] Cool on a wire rack, at least 20 minutes before slicing.
